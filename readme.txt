== Changelog ==

= 1.2.1 = 
* update to fix minor issue with the widget not passing the data container property

= 1.2 = 
* update to fix minor bugs

= 1.1 = 
* Added the ability to specify a parent container from which to find the first paragraph tag.  Simply add your container selector and the plugin will look for it as an ID, if its not found, then will look for a class (and take the first instance of it) or, finding neither, will look for the first paragraph tag on the page.  The ability is encapsulated in the widget, the shortcode and the script tag.
